# Wrangler GitHub Action

✨ Zero-config [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) deployment using [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions)

## Usage

Add `wrangler-action` to the workflow for your Workers application. The below example will publish your application on pushes to the `master` branch:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Publish
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
```

## Authentication

You'll need to configure Wrangler using GitHub's Secrets feature - go to "Settings -> Secrets" and add your Cloudflare API token (for help finding this, see the [Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart/#api-token)). Your API token is encrypted by GitHub, and the action won't print it into logs, so it should be safe!

With your API token set as a secret for your repository, pass it to the action in the `with` block of your workflow. Below, I've set the secret name to `CF_API_TOKEN`:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
```

`wrangler-action` also supports using your [global API key and email](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart/#global-api-key) as an authentication method, although API tokens are preferred. Pass in `apiKey` and `email` to the GitHub Action to use this method:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiKey: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
        email: ${{ secrets.CF_EMAIL }}
```

## Configuration

If you're using Wrangler's [environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments/) feature, you can customize _where_ the action deploys to by passing an `environment` in the `with` block of your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        environment: 'production'
```

To use the Wrangler 2 beta package `wrangler/beta`, pass `true` to the input `wranglerBeta`. Optionally pass the `wranglerVersion` to specify the exact `wrangler` version to use

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        wranglerBeta: true
```

If you need to install a specific version of Wrangler to use for deployment, you can also pass the input `wranglerVersion` to install a specific version of Wrangler from NPM. This should be a [SemVer](https://semver.org/)-style version number, such as `1.6.0`:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        wranglerVersion: '1.6.0'
```

Optionally, you can also pass a `workingDirectory` key to the action. This will allow you to specify a subdirectory of the repo to run the Wrangler command from.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        workingDirectory: 'subfoldername'
```

[Worker secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/secrets/) can be optionally passed as a new line deliminated string of names in `secrets`.  Each secret name must match an environment variable name specified in the `env` attribute.  Creates or replaces the value for the Worker secret using the `wrangler secret put` command.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        secrets: |
            SECRET1
            SECRET2
      env:
        SECRET1: ${{ secrets.SECRET1 }}
        SECRET2: ${{ secrets.SECRET2 }}
```

If you need to run additional shell commands before or after `wrangler publish`, you can specify them as input to `preCommands` (before publish) or `postCommands` (after publish). These can include additional `wrangler` commands (i.e. `build`, `kv:key put`) or any other commands available inside the `wrangler-action` context.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        preCommands: echo "*** pre command ***"
        postCommands: |
          echo "*** post commands ***"
          wrangler kv:key put --binding=MY_KV key2 value2
          echo "******"
```

Set the optional `publish` input to false to skip publishing your Worker project and secrets.  Useful in conjunction with pre and post commands.  For example, if you only wanted to run `wrangler build` against your project:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        publish: false
        preCommands: wrangler build
```

## Use cases

### Deploying when commits are merged to master

The above workflow examples have already shown how to run `wrangler-action` when new commits are merged to the master branch. For most developers, this workflow will easily replace manual deploys and be a great first integration step with `wrangler-action`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Publish
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
```

Note that there are a number of possible events, like `push`, that can be used to trigger a workflow. For more details on the events available, check out the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on).

### Deploying on a schedule

If you'd like to deploy your Workers application on a recurring basis – for instance, every hour, or daily – the `schedule` trigger allows you to use cron syntax to define a workflow schedule. The below example will deploy at the beginning of every hour:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Publish app
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
```

If you need help defining the correct cron syntax, check out [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/), which provides a friendly user interface for validating your cron schedule.

### Deploying on a "dispatched" event

If you need to trigger a workflow at-will, you can use GitHub's `workflow_dispatch` [event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) in your workflow file. By setting your workflow to trigger on that event, you'll be able to deploy your application via the GitHub UI.  The UI also accepts inputs that can be used to configure the action  :

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Choose an environment to deploy to: <dev|staging|prod>'
        required: true
        default: 'dev'
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Publish app
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
          environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}
```

For more advanced usage or to programmatically trigger the workflow from scripts, check out [the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event) for making API calls

## Troubleshooting

This action is in beta, and I'm looking for folks to use it! If something goes wrong, please file an issue! That being said, there's a couple things you should know:

### "I just started using Workers/Wrangler and I don't know what this is!"

No problem! Check out the [Quick Start guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart) in our docs to get started. Once you have a Workers application, you may want to set it up to automatically deploy from GitHub whenever you change your project. That's where this action comes in - nice!

### "I'm trying to deploy my static site but it isn't working!"

To deploy static sites and frontend applications to Workers, check out the documentation for [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites).

Note that this action makes no assumptions about _how_ your project is built! **If you need to run a pre-publish step, like building your application, you need to specify a build step in your Workflow.** For instance, if I have an NPM command called `build`, my workflow YAML might resemble the following:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Build site
        run: 'npm run build'
      - name: Publish
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
```
